#CeylonFX

CeylonFX is a Ceylon interface for JavaFX.

It is currently under active development. Please contact me if you would like to contribute!

Here's a quick example of what it will look like when it's ready:

```ceylon
CeylonFX {
  Stage {
    title = "CeylonFX Demo Application";
      Scene {
        fill = blue;
        Text(50.0, 200.0, "Welcome to CeylonFX"),
        Text(50.0, 275.0, "Under contruction...")
      };
    };
  };
};
```
