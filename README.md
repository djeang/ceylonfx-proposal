#CeylonFX

CeylonFX is a Ceylon interface for JavaFX.

It is currently under active development. Please contact me if you would like to contribute!

Here's a quick example of what code written with CeylonFX looks like *(this example already works)*:

```ceylon
CeylonFX {
	Stage {
		title = "CeylonFX Demo Application";
		Scene {
			fill = blue;
			Text(50.0, 200.0, "Welcome to CeylonFX"),
			Text(50.0, 250.0, "Under construction...")
		};
		
	};
};
```
